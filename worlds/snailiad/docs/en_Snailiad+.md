# Snailiad+

## What is Snailiad+?
Snailiad+ is a remake of the original Snailiad flash game, with new content and features. 
It is a metroidvania-style game where you play as a snail named Snaily, who must save the world from an alien invasion. 
The game features a variety of power-ups and abilities, as well as a large interconnected world to explore.

## What does randomization do to this game?

In the Snailiad+ Randomizer, the locations of all the power-ups and abilities in the game are shuffled around with the 
possibility of being locked behind other power-ups or abilities completely changing how you approach the world.
